_**Assistant**_

Thank you for the detailed requirements! Before I generate your comprehensive README, I have a few clarifying questions to ensure it’s as helpful and accurate as possible:

1. **Project Name Consistency:** Should the README use “Carriage House Group Squarespace Support” as the main title, or do you want a more general/technical name (e.g., “Resume Refresh API” or “Travel Itinerary API”)?  
2. **Demo/Preview:** Do you have any demo URLs, screenshots, or GIFs you’d like included, or should I omit these for now?
3. **Badges:** Do you want placeholder badges (build, version, license), or do you have specific badge URLs/services you prefer (e.g., Shields.io, Vercel status)?
4. **License:** What license (if any) should be referenced? (MIT, Apache, proprietary, etc.)
5. **Changelog:** Is there a changelog or version history file to link, or should I just note where it would go?
6. **Contribution:** Is this project open to outside contributors, or is it strictly internal? Should I include a “Contributing” section or mark it as “Internal Only”?
7. **Contact/Support:** Should I include a contact email or Slack/Discord link for support, or just reference internal channels?

Once you confirm these, I’ll generate a polished, professional README tailored to your needs!

Project Name Consistency: Use "Carriage House Group Squarespace Support" - this is the backend that supports some squarespace integrations. The repo is currently mis-named.

Demo/Preview: omit

Badges: Vercel status would be interesting.

License: Proprietary

Changelog: No.

Contribution: “Internal Only”

Contact/Support: jb@carriagehousegroup.com

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22+
- **Vercel CLI** ([Install](https://vercel.com/docs/cli))
- **OpenAI API Key**
- **pnpm** (recommended, or npm)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo (private/internal)
git clone <internal-repo-url>
cd carriage-house-group-squarespace-support

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your OPENAI_API_KEY, VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN, etc.
```

### Configuration

- **`.env.local`** must include:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
  - `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` (for Vercel integration)
- Connect to your Vercel project with:
  ```bash
  vercel link
  ```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Local development (Vercel dev server)
vercel dev
```

---

## Usage Documentation

### API Endpoints

- **POST `/api/refresh-resume`**: Enhance resumes using OpenAI.
- **POST `/api/travel`**: Generate and validate travel itineraries.

See `api_prd.md` and `travel_web_prd.md` for detailed API specs and requirements.

### Example: Generate a Travel Itinerary

```js
fetch('/api/travel', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    destination: 'Budapest',
    dates: '2025-10-01 to 2025-10-07',
    groupSize: 4,
    details: 'Team offsite, prefer walkable activities.'
  })
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Configuration Options

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
  - `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` (required for Vercel deploys)
  - See `.env.example` for all options
- **Testing:**
  - Uses **vitest** and **newman** for API and integration tests

---

## Features & Capabilities

- **AI-Powered Resume Rewriting**: Accepts resumes, returns ATS-optimized versions
- **Travel Itinerary Generation**: Structured, validated, and scannable plans
- **Verification & Data Source Transparency**: Collapsible sections, source links
- **Embeddable HTML Fragments**: For seamless Squarespace integration
- **Modular, Extensible API**: Add new endpoints/features as needed
- **Internal-Only**: Not for public or client use

### Roadmap
- [ ] Itinerary revision workflow (see docs/1_planning/revision_feature.prd.md)
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and logging
- [ ] More embeddable UI fragments

---

## Development Setup

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
vercel dev
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test         # Runs vitest
pnpm run newman   # Runs Postman/newman API tests
```

### Workflow
- Feature-driven development (see ``)
- Use Vercel for serverless deployment
- All code in `` (see Project Structure)

### Debugging Tips
- Check `` for dev and error logs
- Use `vercel logs` for cloud logs
- API errors are sanitized; check server logs for details

- **Stateless**: No persistent backend storage
- **OpenAI Integration**: All AI logic handled via OpenAI API
- **HTML Fragments**: Designed for easy embedding in Squarespace

#### Diagrams
See `` for:
- Data flow diagrams (e.g., `intinerary-data-flow.png`, `resume-data-flow.png`)
- Architecture and process documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **API returns 401/403**: Check your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and Vercel token
- **Vercel deploy fails**: Ensure you are linked to the correct Vercel project and environment variables are set
- **Markdown not rendering**: Ensure the `marked` package is installed and up to date
- **Test failures**: Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are present

### FAQ
- **Is this project open source?**  
  No, this is a proprietary, internal project.
- **Can I use this for other Squarespace sites?**  
  Only with internal approval.
- **Where is the changelog?**  
  Changelog/version history is tracked internally.

*This README is for internal use only. Do not distribute externally.*

Let me know if you want this applied to your `README.md` file or if you need any adjustments!

---

_**User (2025-09-17 21:01Z)**_

apply it to README.md

---

_**Assistant**_

The new README content is ready, but the patch failed due to a mismatch with the current file context (likely because the file is very short and doesn't match the expected lines). 

Would you like me to overwrite the entire `README.md` file with the new content directly? This will fully replace the old README and ensure your documentation is up to date. Let me know if you want to proceed with a full overwrite!

---

_**User (2025-09-17 21:01Z)**_

yes

_**Assistant**_


````

````
Your `README.md` has been fully replaced with the new, comprehensive documentation for Carriage House Group Squarespace Support. The file now includes all the requested sections, usage details, and internal-only guidance.

If you need further adjustments or want to add more project-specific details, just let me know!
